Quick and dirty reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning project. Not the most efficient, secure, and stable code. All I know is that this code led me to many bugs : )

If it happened and I made this repo public, I apologize for not documenting it. Just read the code files, and you will understand it : ). 

It integrates the following tools.
